# stableDiffusionPractice

Stable Diffusion allows text to translate into an image. It is a latent diffusion model which is a variety of deep generative neural network and deep learning generated by developers in the CompVis group. All of the examples that I have provided in the file are computer generated images and no direct image imports were made. 

I learned about the systematic process within Stable Diffusion and the dynamic backbone behind it.
