# stableDiffusionPractice

Stable Diffusion allows text to translate into an image. It is a latent diffusion model which is a variety of deep generative neural network and deep learning generated by developers in the CompVis group. The model slowly adds noise to the given image until the image becomes pure noise. The model will then learn how to reverse these noise to recover a high-quality image. All of the examples that I have provided in the example file are computer generated images and no direct image imports were made. 

I learned about the systematic process within Stable Diffusion and the dynamic backbone behind it.
